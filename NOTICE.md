Contributions have helped in the successful development of this script and project immensely.  Understanding the goals and workings of this project shall make interacting with this project all the more rewarding.  If you are considering collaborating, help is wanted in:
1. Coding - Submit modifications in the `scripts/files` directory at [https://github.com/sdrausty/dfa](https://github.com/sdrausty/dfa) Run `/scripts/maintenance/makedownload.sh` to generate checksums and files, 
2. Documentation - Submit modifications at [https://github.com/sdrausty/dfa](https://github.com/sdrausty/dfa),  

__To avoid "git bloat", this repositories are reset periodically!__  This is also one of the reasons why this project is distributed in these repositories.  If you get a `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` message while working with your current clone, save the important work from your current clone and reclone.

To understand more about "git bloat", run `du -hs .git` on older more mature projects.  Some might have a very large .git directory.  A very large .git directory can impede working with a git repository, especially when utilizing a slow Internet connection. This is why this repository is periodically reset.
